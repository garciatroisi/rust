# Rust Program Execution Instructions

This folder contains a program written in Rust. To run it successfully, follow the steps below:

## Execution Steps

1. **Compile the program**: Use the Rust compiler (`rustc`) to compile the `main.rs` file. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   rustc main.rs
   ```

   This will generate an executable file named `main` in the current directory.

2. **Run the program**: Once the program has been successfully compiled, you can execute it using the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   ./main
   ```

   This will run the program and display its output in the terminal.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the Rust compiler installed on your system before attempting to compile and run the program. You can find instructions on how to install Rust in [the official Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
