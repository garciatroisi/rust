# Rust Program Execution Instructions

This folder contains a program written in Rust using Cargo. To run it successfully, follow the steps below:

## Execution Steps

1. **Compile and run the program**: Use use cargo run to compile the code and then run the resultant executable all in one command:

   ```sh
  cargo run
   ```

   This will generate a "target" folder in the current directory. 

## Requirements

Make sure you have the Rust compiler installed on your system before attempting to compile and run the program. You can find instructions on how to install Rust in [the official Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
